Hi, I am a Masters graduate from Simon Fraser University (SFU), Burnaby. I worked on Hyperspectral imaging, exploring its applications, and expanding the capabilities of regular smartphones.

I worked on using specialized smartphone cameras (like face authentication camera) to generate hyperspectral images on smartphones. The goal of this is to uncover hidden information present in the Near Infrared region of the EM spectrum. This research was backed by a couple of applications like detecting food fraud in fruits and liquids, detecting ripeness levels and remaining lifetime of foods.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science (BSCS) from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in 2020. At NUST, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Cognet Lab, focusing on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and using them to generate high fidelity images of religious architecture.
